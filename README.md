# best-dressed-vote

Made by Samuel Paul Christopher to make the best dressed competition voting procedure for the MPP 17/18 Appreciation Night more accurate. The system has real-time voting results. Before deciding to go with the voting system, we conducted a fair controlled test. We voted the analogue way and voted using the system to see if our analogue and digital results would tally. To our surprise, the votes did not tally after the first round of counting. Upon careful inspection, we realized that we made human error in counting our analogue votes. The digital votes were accurate after all! :clap:
